pyhdfquickplot

Description: This software was originally intended for quickly plotting HDF files associated with space
weather data sources. Some functionality is incomplete such as an implementation of a HDF data source
downloader within the program itself, three dimensional plotting, and simultaneous plotting of separate
HDF files. This program was made before my familiarity with multi-threaded applications in PyQt (and
multi-threaded applications in general) so this functionality is not present yet. As with all non-multi-
threaded applications, expect a delay when plotting figures. Currently, when HDF4 files are opened, they
are automatically converted to HDF5 which is the only format of HDF files that 'h5py' will understand.
There may very well be some errors associated with this process.

Requirements:
> Windows-Based Computer*
	- This can easily be changed because the only portion relying on the operating system is whether the Windows or Linux version of the HDF5 converter is being used.
> Python 2.7+
	- Have not tried with 3.3. More than likely works after a little bit of syntax
	changing (such as print statements).
> PyQt4
	- Have not tried with the newer PyQt5 seeing as how it didn't exist when
	this software was written.
> Matplotlib
> h5py
